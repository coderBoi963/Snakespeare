# Snakespeare, the snake game

This is a very basic snake game created using Python's pygame module.



## How to use it

If you want to develop the game further, you need to have pygame module installed. To install pygame module, open up terminal and execute the following command

```bash
  pip install pygame
```

If you just want to play the game, then you can do so by going to **dist** folder and execute **main.py**
